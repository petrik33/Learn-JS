This project contains solutions to the [Learn JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) book tasks

It also features the task description for each page with the help of [Marked JS](https://marked.js.org/) and browser fetch API.

Each solution is original and provided by myself. The source code can be freely used for your own inspiration.
